## Deployment and Functionality

I saw that you might of tried to deploy at some point - based on your commits, and the inclusion of the rails12factor gem but I couldn't find a link to a deployed version of your app anywhere. I'd be happy to look at it if you can link me to it.

Evaluation: *Incomplete*

## Planning / Process / Submission

App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality and link to deployed application. Your initial planning was great. You could have added a few more user granular user stories. I encourage you to treat planning as a living documentation on future projects and update it and check stuff off as the requirements of the project adapt. Additionally, it's great to include a little bit of info on the main readme.md about how to get the app up and running and how contributors should approach it.

Evaluation: *Progressing*
